## Usage

### Version 0.5
Open either a cbr- or cbz-file and wait until the first page shows up (this might take a while, depending on the file-size).
You can get to the next page by pushing Enter on your keyboard. Push Backspace to get to the previous image. 

### Version 1.0
Like with version 0.5, open a comic-book-file (which may take some time). You can use *'Enter'* and *'Backspace'* to go through the images forward / backward. You can also use the list on the left side and the up/down-arrow-keys.

## How the program works
A cbz-file is more or less a zip-file, a cbr-file is more or less a rar-file. The program unzips / unrars the selected archive-file into a temporary folder on your computer. Afterwards the images simply get displayed by the application.
